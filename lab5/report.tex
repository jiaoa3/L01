\section{\(k\)-Heap}
\label{sec:kheap}

The asymptotic complexity of \texttt{sink} is believed to be \(\mathcal{O}(k
\log_{k}{n})\). In a \(k\)-heap, the nodes are organized in a complete \(k\)-ary
tree of height \(\log_{k}{n}\). In the worst case, a node \(e\), needs to “sink”
through \(\log_{k}{n}\) levels. On each level, \(k\) comparisons are required to
find the maximum element on the level. The maximum would then be swapped with
node \(e\). Hence, the complexity of \texttt{sink} is \(k\) comparisons times
\(\log_{k}{n}\) levels, \(\mathcal{O}(k \log_{k}{n})\).

A \(k\)-heap is essentially a \(k\)-ary tree. The height of a \(k\)-ary tree is
\(\log_{k}{n}\), which is smaller than that of a binary tree (heap), \(\lg{n}\).
The \texttt{swim} operation on a \(k\)-ary heap is \(\mathcal{O}(\log_{k}{n})\).
On the other hand, a larger \(k\) results in requiring more comparisons for
\texttt{sink} on each level of the tree. Therefore, in cases where applications
depending solely on the \texttt{swim} operation are prioritized over all other
operations, \(k\)-heaps of a large \(k\) have a huge advantage over binary
heaps. In other cases where \texttt{sink} or both \texttt{swim} and
\texttt{sink} are heavily used, such as Heapsort, \(k\)-heaps of any \(k\) are
not significantly better than binary heaps. In fact, the function family \(y =
k\log_{k}{x}\) minimizes for \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) at \(k = 3\), which means
3-ary heap is better than binary heap in most aspects, and any \(k\)-heap of \(k
> 3\) trades off its \texttt{sink} performance for that of \texttt{swim}.
