\subsection{Experiment 2: Revert and Reset}

The git revert command can be considered an 'undo' type command, however, it is
not a traditional undo operation. Instead of removing the commit from the
project history, it figures out how to invert the changes introduced by the
commit and appends a new commit with the resulting inverse content. This
prevents Git from losing history, which is important for the integrity of your
revision history and for reliable collaboration.

Reverting should be used when you want to apply the inverse of a commit from
your project history. This can be useful, for example, if youâ€™re tracking down a
bug and find that it was introduced by a single commit. Instead of manually
going in, fixing it, and committing a new snapshot, you can use git revert to
automatically do all of this for you.

The git reset command is a complex and versatile tool for undoing changes. It
has three primary forms of invocation. These forms correspond to command line
arguments --soft, --mixed, --hard. The three arguments each correspond to Git's
three internal state management mechanism's, The Commit Tree (HEAD), The Staging
Index, and The Working Directory.
